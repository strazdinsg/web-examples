      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        The purpose of the exercise is to practice configuring flexbox,
        including item properties. There is a popular pattern in web
        development, called "media pattern". The idea is to display an image and
        text side by side, without wrapping the text around the image. An
        example could be a comment on a blog article. In this exercise you will
        create a flexible container for displaying the media object and a text.
      </p>

      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <p>
        Create an HTML document with an image and a text or reasonable length
        (how about Emmet expression <code>lipsum800</code> ?). You can use
        images from <a href="https://picsum.photos/">Lorem Picsum</a>. Align
        them as in the media object pattern:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Image on the left, text on the right.</li>
        <li>Image should fill 30% of the available width, the text: 70%.</li>
        <li>
          Minimum width for the image: 150px. Minimum width for the text column:
          350px.
        </li>
        <li>
          Both image and text containers should dynamically expand if there is
          more space available.
        </li>
        <li>Image should have correct proportions.</li>
        <li>
          The image should have 20px margin on the sides (not on the top).
        </li>
        <li>
          If there is not enough horizontal space available, a scrollbar should
          appear. I.e., the text should not wrap under the image.
        </li>
        <li>
          Now try to align the image on the right. If you have done it
          correctly, it should be a single additional line of CSS code.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>The following CSS properties may be handy (for the container):</p>
      <pre><code>
        display: flex;
        flex-wrap
        flex-basis
        flex-grow
        flex-shrink
        align-self
        order
        min-width
        margin
    </code></pre>

      <p>Here you can see a an example of how it could look:</p>
      <img
        src="img/media-object-example.jpg"
        alt="An image with a woman on the left and a text paragraph on the right"
      />
      <p>And this is how it could look when you move the image to the right:</p>
      <img
        src="img/media-object-example2.jpg"
        alt="An image with a woman on the right and a text paragraph on the left"
      />

      <h2>Extra challenge</h2>
      <p>
        Try nesting the image and text. It should work "out of the box". This
        could be useful in blogs with commenting feature. P.S. There could be
        some issues with the min-width though.
      </p>
