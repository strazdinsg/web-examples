      <p>Go <a href="../../index.html">back to exercise list</a>.</p>

      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        The purpose of the exercise is to <em>get your hands dirty</em> with CSS
        flexbox layout. Well, and to get used to writing HTML and CSS code. It's
        like playing piano - practice is needed to
        <em>get it in your fingers.</em>
      </p>

      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <p>
        Your task is to create an HTML document and necessary CSS styling to get
        the necessary result described below. You decide whether to embed
        <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> block in the heading, or to include an
        external .css file.
      </p>

      <p>Requirements:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Create a flexbox container.</li>
        <li>
          It must contain five child elements, let's call them <em>items</em>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Each item should contain some text in it. For example, numbers 1, 2,
          ..., 5.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add a border to the flexbox container and each item to see their
          boundaries.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Extra challenge</h2>
      <p>
        If you are done with the exercise too fast and are bored, you can
        practice CSS:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Recreate the look used in
          <a href="https://learningwebdesign.com">the book</a>:
          <img
            src="img/flexbox-with-items.png"
            height="50px"
            alt="flexbox with five colored items: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5"
          />
        </li>
        <li>Add some fancy effects, such as shadows, hover effects</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Template</h2>
      <p>
        Although you could use this file as a template, it can be a good
        practice to start from scratch - get the feeling of creating HTML
        documents!
      </p>

      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <p>
        You can find a solution in
        <a href="../solutions/ex01-solution.html"
          ><code>../solutions/ex01-solution.html</code></a
        >.
      </p>

      <h2>Side note(s)</h2>
      <p>
        P.S. If your code editor supports
        <a href="https://emmet.io/">Emmet</a> (WebStorm does), you can create
        the child items with this emmet-shortcut: <code>div{$}*5</code>. Type it
        and then press Tab (or Ctrl+E in some editors).
        <a href="https://docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet/">Emmet's Cheat sheet here</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        Explanation: <code>div{$}*5</code> means "create element &lt;div&gt;
        with the <em>loop index</em> as the text content, repeat that in a loop
        5 times".
      </p>
      <p>
        A small quiz-question for you: how will this Emmet expression be
        expanded: <code>div#item$*5</code>? Hint: how about you try it and see
        for yourself? :)
