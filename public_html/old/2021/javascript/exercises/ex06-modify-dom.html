      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        The purpose of the exercise is learn how you can access and modify some
        properties of DOM elements.
      </p>

      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>Part 1 - add/remove class</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Create a page with one paragraph of text.</li>
          <li>
            Add a CSS block which sets a yellow background and font to "Courier
            New" for all items with class "yellow".
          </li>
          <li>Add two buttons A and B to the page.</li>
          <li>
            Button A should have a text "Add". When user clicks on it, class
            "yellow" is added to the text paragraph (and hence it should get a
            yellow background).
          </li>
          <li>
            Button B should have a text "Remove". A click on it removes the
            "yellow" class from the paragraph.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Part 2 - color picker</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Find out, how you can <i>catch</i> the event of user picking a value
            in selectbox, and how you can read the value.
          </li>
          <li>
            Create a page with a text "Pick your favorite color", and a
            selectbox with values ["Red", "Green" "Roundhouse kick"].
          </li>

          <li>
            Add a text which says: "I see that your favorite color is …". Hint
            it is probably a good idea to create a paragraph for the whole
            sentence and include a span for the placeholder of the color.
            Something along these lines:
            <code
              >&lt;p&gt;I see that your favorite color
              is&lt;span&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code
            >. You probably also want an ID for the span to get a reference to
            it in Javascript.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add Javascript which reacts on user picking a color and replaces the
            "…" with the name of the chosen color.
          </li>
          <li>
            Extend the solution of the previous exercise, add some more colors
            to the selectbox.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add a div of a certain size (for example, 220x150 pixels), set
            <code>id="color-example"</code> for it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Whenever the user picks a color in the selectbox, set the background
            color of that div to the chosen color. Hint: you probably want to
            define color codes (such as <code>#ff0000</code>) as values for the
            selecbox options, in addition to the values displayed for the user.
            An example:
            <code>&lt;option value="#ff0000"&gt;Red&lt;/option&gt;</code>. You
            will also need to modify the code displaying the user-friendly value
            of the color. Find out on the net how you can access the index of
            selected item for a selectbox, and then text of the selected option.
          </li>
          <li>
            Extra challenge: when "Roundhouse kick" is selected, set background
            image of the div with id="example" to a picture of
            <i>you know whom.</i>
          </li>
        </ol>
