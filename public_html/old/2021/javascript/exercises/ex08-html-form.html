      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>Part 1 - a "login" form</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Create a document with an HTML form.</li>
          <li>
            Set the forms method to <code>POST</code> and target (the URL of the
            receiving script) to
            <code>https://web-tek.ninja/php_backend/dummy_login.php</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the following input fields in it:
            <ol>
              <li>
                A text input with name <code>username</code> and default value
                "john".
              </li>
              <li>A password input with name <code>key</code>.</li>
              <li>Add labels for the inputs</li>
              <li>Add a hidden field with a name and value of your choice.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Add a "Submit form" button.</li>
          <li>
            Try to post the form. You should get an HTML page in response
            (generated by a dynamic PHP script on the server). Check out what
            the page is saying and find what you need to enter in the
            <code>key</code>
            field to get a "total success" :).
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Part 2 - extra challenge</h3>
        <p>
          This part requires a bit of <i>hacking</i> - exploration of an
          existing website. The task is to create an external search field for
          <a href="https://jula.no">jula.no</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Create your own website with a text input field and a submit button.
          Make the title of the button "Det er Jula snart!". When the user
          presses the button, she should be redirected to Jula.no webpage and
          should see search results for the item that was entered in the text
          input.
