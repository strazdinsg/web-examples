      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        The purpose of the exercise is learn how you can remove elements from
        the DOM and add new ones.
      </p>

      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>Part 1 - add a paragraph on button-click</h3>
        <p>
          Create a document with a button. Create Javascript which adds a
          &lt;p&gt;Hello!&lt;/p&gt; to the document every time the user presses
          the button.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Part 2 - add a table row</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Extend the previous example: create a table with two columns. Add
            one row in it, with any content you want. Add a button. Every time
            the user clicks on the button, add a new row to the table with text
            "Hello" in one column and "World" in the other column. Hint:
            <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> has <code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code> as the
            direct child, rows should be added to the
            <code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code> element not to the
            <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> directly!
          </li>
          <li>
            Extend the previous example: add a button "Remove last row". When
            the user clicks on it, the last row of the table is removed. If the
            table has only one row left, an alert is shown saying "Can't remove
            the last row", and the row is not removed.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Part 3 - div inside a box</h3>
        <p>
          Add a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element to the page, set it's height
          and width to 100px, background color to green. Make the
          <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element escape - when the user moves the
          mouse over it, the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element is removed from
          the place it currently
          <i>sits</i>
          and is moved to a random place in the table above. I.e, it is added to
          a random row and random column inside the table you created in the
          previous steps.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Part 4 - div outside the box</h3>
        <p>
          Extra challenge: add some more content to the page (some headings,
          paragraphs, etc) and make the div escape randomly at any place in the
          DOM tree. I.e., don't limit it's placement to the table.
        </p>
