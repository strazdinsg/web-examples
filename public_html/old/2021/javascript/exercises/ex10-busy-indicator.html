        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>Extend your solution for the previous exercise:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Send the request to a new URL:
            <code>https://web-tek.ninja/php_backend/delayed_dice.php</code>.
            This API creates an artificial delay to simulate a long request.
          </li>
          <li>
            Show some kind of busy indicator to the user while the request is in
            progress.
          </li>
          <li>Remember to hide the indicator when the response is received.</li>
        </ol>
