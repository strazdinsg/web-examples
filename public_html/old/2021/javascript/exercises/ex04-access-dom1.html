      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        The purpose of the exercise is learn how you can access specific
        elements in the DOM tree.
      </p>

      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <h3>Part 1 - inspect an existing site in the console</h3>

      <p>
        Go to <a href="https://web-tek.ninja">https://web-tek.ninja</a> in your
        browser (preferably in another tab), open developer tool console and
        explore the DOM:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          type <code>document.body</code> in the console, hit
          <code>Enter</code>. What do you see?
        </li>
        <li>
          Select the heading "CSS exercises" and save the reference to it in a
          variable <code>heading1</code>. You can do that by issuing the
          following command in the console:
          <code
            >var heading1 =
            document.getElementById('css-exercise-heading');</code
          >
          Now change the text of the heading to "Cool exercises".
        </li>
        <li>
          Find the ID of the heading "CSS Grid exercises". Hint: you can
          right-click on it with the mouse, select Inspect. The Elements tab of
          dev tools will be opened, and the element selected. Do you see the
          id="..."?
        </li>
        <li>
          Now change the text of this heading (from the previous step) to
          "Hei!".
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>
        Create your
        <abbr title="Even if it is not the first, it's fun, right? :)"
          >first</abbr
        >
        DYNAMIC websites!
      </h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Create a page which has one paragraph (<code>&lt;p&gt;</code>) element
          in it. The text inside it should be "Loading...". Now add a Javascript
          to the page, which sets the text in the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element
          to "Hello" when the page is loaded.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add a paragraph to the same page (or create a new page if you want)
          that shows a text: "<i>X</i> seconds have passed since the page was
          loaded”. Update <i>X</i> every second.
        </li>
        <li>
          Create a "calculator":
          <ol type="i">
            <li>
              Two text inputs (let us call them A and B), the user can input a
              number in each of them. Set A=3, B=5 by default.
            </li>
            <li>A text saying: "the two numbers multiplied are <i>X</i>".</li>
            <li>
              Update the <i>X</i> to be A*B whenever text changes in any of the
              inputs.
            </li>
            <li>
              Extra challenge: show "Not a number!" when either A or B (or both)
              are not numbers.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
