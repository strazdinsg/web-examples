        example of a holy grail layout:
      </p>
      <img
        src="img/holy-grail-example.jpg"
        class="reference-img"
        alt="Holy grail layout example"
      />

      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <p>

        may need to do some HTML changes as well (Hint: all the areas must be
        direct child of grid, including nav, main and ads).
