      <h1>Exercise 10.7</h1>
      <p>
        This is Exercise 10.7, lecture on traversing DOM with Javascript, used

          >IDATA2301 Web technologies</a

      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        The purpose of the exercise is to learn how you can select more than one
        element and traverse the children.
      </p>

      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Create an HTML document with a 3x3 grid container. An opportunity to
          remember how CSS grids work ;).
        </li>
        <li>Put 9 div elements inside it.</li>
        <li>
          For even div elements add <code>class="even"</code> (div number 2, 4,
          …, 8), for odd elements (div number 1, 3, …, 9) add
          <code>class="odd"</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Write a Javascript code (execute it when the page is loaded) which
          sets text to "X" for all odd elements (those with
          <code>class="odd"</code>) and sets text to "O" for all elements with
          <code>class="even"</code>.
        </li>

        <li>
          Extra challenge: find out how you can do the same even if you don't
          assign any classes to the nine divs. I.e., you can access odd and even
          child elements separately, with specific selectors. Hint: how would
          you access those in CSS?
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>It should look something like this in the end:</p>
      <img
        src="reference.png"
        alt="Tic tac toe with X on diagonals and O in other places"
      />

      <h2>Solution</h2>
