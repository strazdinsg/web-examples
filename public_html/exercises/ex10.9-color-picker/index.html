      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        The purpose of the exercise is to learn how you can access and modify
        some properties of DOM elements.
      </p>

      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Find out, how you can <i>catch</i> the event of user picking a value
          in selectbox, and how you can read the value.
        </li>
        <li>
          Create a page with a text "Pick your favorite color", and a selectbox
          with values ["Red", "Green" "Roundhouse kick"].
        </li>

        <li>
          Add a text which says: "I see that your favorite color is …". Hint it
          is probably a good idea to create a paragraph for the whole sentence
          and include a span for the placeholder of the color. Something along
          these lines:
          <code
            >&lt;p&gt;I see that your favorite color
            is&lt;span&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code
          >. You probably also want an ID for the span to get a reference to it
          in Javascript.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add Javascript which reacts on user picking a color and replaces the
          "…" with the name of the chosen color.
        </li>
        <li>
          Extend the solution of the previous exercise, add some more colors to
          the selectbox.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add a div of a certain size (for example, 220x150 pixels), set
          <code>id="color-example"</code> for it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Whenever the user picks a color in the selectbox, set the background
          color of that div to the chosen color. Hint: you probably want to
          define color codes (such as <code>#ff0000</code>) as values for the
          selecbox options, in addition to the values displayed for the user. An
          example:
          <code>&lt;option value="#ff0000"&gt;Red&lt;/option&gt;</code>. You
          will also need to modify the code displaying the user-friendly value
          of the color. Find out on the net how you can access the index of
          selected item for a selectbox, and then text of the selected option.
        </li>
        <li>
          Extra challenge: when "Roundhouse kick" is selected, set background
          image of the div with <code>id="color-example"</code> to a picture of
          <i>you know whom.</i>
        </li>
      </ol>
