      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        The purpose of the exercise is to learn how you can remove elements from
        the DOM and add new ones.
      </p>

      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>Part 1 - Add/remove a table row</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Create a document and add a table with two columns.</li>
          <li>Add three rows in it, with any content you want.</li>
          <li>Add a button with text "Add a row".</li>
          <li>
            Every time the user clicks on the button, add a new row to the table
            with text "Hello" in one column and "World" in the other column.
            Hint: <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> has <code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code> as
            the direct child, rows should be added to the
            <code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code> element not to the
            <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> directly!
          </li>
          <li>
            Extend the previous example: add a button "Remove last row". When
            the user clicks on it, the last row of the table is removed.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the table has three or fever rows left, an alert must be shown
            saying "Can't remove the last 3 rows", and the row must not be
            removed.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Part 2 - div inside a box</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Add a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element to the page, set its height
            and width to <code>20px</code>, background color to
            <code>green</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Make the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element escape - when the user
            moves the mouse over it, the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element is
            removed from the place it currently <i>sits</i> and is moved to a
            random place in the table above. I.e, it is added to a random row
            and random column inside the table you created in the previous
            steps.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Part 3 - div outside the box</h3>
        <p>
          Extra challenge: add some more content to the page (some headings,
          paragraphs, etc.) and make the div escape randomly at any place in the
          DOM tree. I.e., don't limit its placement to the table.
        </p>
