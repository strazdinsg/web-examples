    </p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>
      If you are done and have some time left, use the time creatively! For
      example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Display a
        <a
          href="https://betterprogramming.pub/creating-dice-in-flexbox-in-css-a02a5d85e516"
          >real dice</a
        >
        instead of a number.
      </li>
      <li>
        Allow the user to throw multiple dice at once (Yes
        <a href="https://www.grammarly.com/blog/dice-die/"
          >both "die" and "dice" are legit singular forms of the word</a
        >). Several ways to do it. One of them: if you send an HTTP POST
        (instead of a GET) and specify n=X (where X is the number of dice you
        want to get, in the range 1..10) to the same API url, you will get a
        JSON array back with X dice values, instead of a single value.
      </li>
      <li>
        Explore other options for sending HTTP requests. Did you use
        <code>fetch</code> with promises? Try <code>fetch</code> with
        <code>await</code>. Or try <code>XmlHttpRequest</code>.
      </li>
    </ul>
