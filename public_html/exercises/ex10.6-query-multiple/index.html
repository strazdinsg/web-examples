      <p>Go <a href="../..">back to exercise list</a>.</p>

      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        The purpose of the exercise is to learn how you can select more than one
        element
      </p>

      <h2>Instructions</h2>

      <p>
        Go to <a href="https://web-tek.ninja">https://web-tek.ninja</a> in your
        browser (preferably in another tab), open developer tool console and
        explore the DOM:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Select all <code>h2</code> elements on the site: type
          <code>document.querySelectorAll('h2')</code> in the console, press
          <kbd>Enter</kbd>. Explore the NodeList you get in return. Open it.
          What happens when you move the mouse over the first element in the
          array?
        </li>
        <li>
          Select all elements with class <code>css-exercise</code>. You should
          get all 7 <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>
          elements containing links to CSS exercises. But you probably got only
          6 items, right. Can you find what is missing? P.S. Debugging and
          finding mistakes in HTML, CSS and Javascript is an essential skill!
        </li>
        <li>
          Select the first <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> element on the page,
          store it in a variable.
        </li>
        <li>
          Now use that variable to find all <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> elements
          inside that article. How many did you get? What do they refer to?
        </li>
      </ol>
