    <p>Here we show that Javascript engine is single-threaded.</p>
    <p>
      When you press on Button A, it will consume the processor for some time
      and then add a paragraph to the DOM. When you press on Button B, it will
      immediately add a paragraph to the DOM. To see that the JS engine is
      single-threaded, try to press button A, and shortly after press button B a
      couple of times. You should see that nothing happens for a while, and
      after that your button B clicks are processed. This shows the behaviour of
      event queue in Javascript - the browser is multi-threaded and can capture
      user events, but it places it to JS engine event queue, and the
      single-threaded JS engine processes those events one after another.
