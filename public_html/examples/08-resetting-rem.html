    <p>
      In this example we reset rem to 10px. This is a typical technique for web
      developers - makes the usage of rem units easier. How do we do that? We
      redefine the font size for <code>html</code> tag. Because that is rem by
      definition: 1 rem = font size of <code>html</code> element. Check out the
      <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> section in this document!
    </p>
    <p>
      After this manipulation, text becomes tiny. But we can easily fix that by
      setting <code>font-size</code> to necessary elements.
